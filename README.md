# OtherTagHighlighting
Plugin to highlight matching tags for Geany editor. Based on "Pair tag highlighter" plugin by kvm.

### Motivation
To fix some shortcomings in "Pair tag highlighting", e.g. inconsistent function naming in code.
Unfortunately, "Pair tag highlighting" isn't developed in the open, the version in Volodymir's repo is 
*older* than the one bundled in geany-plugins.
